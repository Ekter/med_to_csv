Introduction
=============
med_to_csv is a project that aims to transform med associates data files into tidy data. 
The software parses several types of raw data files obtained from med associates and outputs a 
CSV file containing the information needed.
Since med associates allows to fill freely the information needed, the resulting data layout
will differ from user to user. 
In this software, the user should specify which information to keep and where this information
is present.
